Offline Music Player
Now a days sensors are very common in smartphones and these sensors can be used in the apps to get better user experience. “Music Player” is one of the apps that we use in our daily life. In the modern smartphone there is at least one “music player” app is pre-installed.
- Gesture: In this app we have used custom made gesture features. Generally android library provides “tapping”, “double tapping”, “fling” etc. as gesture. But if user wants to do other gestures then it’s not possible to do perform with the traditional gesture library. In this project we backtracked a third party app named “gesture builder”. With the help of this app we custom made three gestures:

Tick (✓): plays or pauses the current song.

Left to Right (->): plays previous song.

Right to Left (<-): plays next song.
